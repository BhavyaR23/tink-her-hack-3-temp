[InstaDish Web App](https://insta-dish.vercel.app/)

### Project Description
InstaDish is a web app that allows users to input the ingredients they have at home, and it will suggest recipes that can be made using those ingredients. This app helps users find creative meal ideas, reduce food waste, and save time in the kitchen by making the most of what they already have.

### The Problem Statement
Many people often find themselves with a fridge full of ingredients but no idea what to cook. This leads to food wastage, and a tendency to order or buy pre-made meals, which can be costly and unhealthy. There is a need for a solution that helps users make the most of the ingredients they already have in their kitchens by suggesting suitable recipes.

### The Solution
InstaDish provides a simple and effective solution to the problem of meal planning with limited ingredients. By allowing users to input the ingredients they have at home, the app generates personalized recipe suggestions. The app offers a convenient, user-friendly platform that helps users create meals with what they already have on hand.
